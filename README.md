## Description

This project is about making a template for easy readme creation. Using Inquirer we can populate the various fields in the readme straight from the terminal. The generateMarkdown.js handles the rendering of the readme using template literals. Learning how to pull from Github's api to grab a user's profile image and data was challenging for me, I think because I'm still green with modularizing my js files.
